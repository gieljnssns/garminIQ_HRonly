# garminIQ_HRonly
vivoActive HR app to show and broadcast HR only

I created this simple heart-rate app so I can use my Garmin 820 on my bike ride while the watch (Garmin vivoActive HR) send over my HR so the 820 can show it and record it as part of my cycling ride.
This app don't use GPS and the hope is that it is fairly "nice" in terms of battery usage.

Upon initial run, the app may show simple animation - this is just a visual time killer until the sensor send real data.
